# Music Tweet

Simple app for iOS & watchOS to quickly share on Twitter the currently played track, including the artist and, if you want, the album artwork.

*My very first iOS app back in early 2014.\
I'm still using it at least every other day for [@Tomn_Music](https://twitter.com/tomn_music "View Twitter account").*

*__v2.0__ May 2017: Now comes with an Apple Watch app!\
Now connects with Twitter OAuth*
